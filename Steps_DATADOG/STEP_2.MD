Infrastructure Monitoring:
│   ├── Monitor CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and network traffic on a fleet of servers to identify and troubleshoot performance issues.

Application Performance Monitoring (APM):
│   ├── Track response times, error rates, and transaction throughput for a web application to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.

Log Management:
│   ├── Collect and centralize logs from applications and infrastructure to investigate incidents, detect patterns, and gain insights into system behavior.

Real User Monitoring (RUM):
│   ├── Monitor real user interactions with a web or mobile application to identify and improve user experience issues.

Synthetics:
│   ├── Proactively test the availability and performance of web applications and APIs from different locations and perspectives.

Security Monitoring:
│   ├── Monitor for suspicious activity, detect intrusions, and enforce security policies to protect infrastructure and applications from cyberattacks.

Tracing:
│   ├── Track the entire path of a request across multiple services and microservices to identify and troubleshoot performance bottlenecks and errors.

Distributed Tracing:
│   ├── Gain visibility into the performance and behavior of distributed systems across multiple nodes and services.

Container Monitoring:
│   ├── Monitor the health, performance, and resource usage of containers to ensure optimal operation and identify potential issues.

Serverless Monitoring:
│   ├── Monitor the invocation and execution of serverless functions to ensure reliability, performance, and cost optimization.

Dashboards and Alerts:
